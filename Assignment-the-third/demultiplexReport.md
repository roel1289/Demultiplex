# Demultiplex Project Report


## Filtering
I chose to filter the data by removing all "N" values. This is because I want to keep all levels of cutoffs, just not the "N"s.
By chosing a different cutoff, I might be removing valuable information.

## Overall types and percentages
|Type|Occurences|Percentage|
|---|---|---|
|matched|331755033|91.33|
hopped|707740|0.19
unknown|30783962|8.47

## Percentage of reads from each sample
Found in [Final Results](https://github.com/roel1289/Demultiplex/blob/master/Assignment-the-third/finalResults.md)  
The table in these results shows each indexing combination, whether it's matched or hopped. I have provided how many occurrences there are and its percentage. 
One interesting piece of data was the index matching pair TACCGGAT-TACCGGAT. This pair occured around 21% of the all samples, which is far greater than other percentages.  
This means that a large amount of data came from a similar location. 

## Overall amount of index swapping
Found in [Final Results](https://github.com/roel1289/Demultiplex/blob/master/Assignment-the-third/finalResults.md)
In this file, my table named, "Percentage of Hopped Pair" describes each combination and how often they occured. In general, only 0.19%  
of the records hopped which is a low amount and proves it is quality sequencing data.
